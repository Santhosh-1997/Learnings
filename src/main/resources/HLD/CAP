CAP
    - Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
    - Impossible to distributed system to provide all three

    Consistency
        - It should be consistent across all nodes even if it takes some toll on latency

    Availability
        - All nodes should be available even if the result from some nodes are not reflected yet

    Network Partitions
        - When there is some issue with the network between the nodes, the system has to choose between
        consistency and availability


Design Strategies
    Eventual Consistency
    Strong Consistency
    Tunable Consistency
    Quoroum based Approaches


PACELC
    If Partition, trade off is b/w Availabilty and Consistency
    Else Latency and Consistency
