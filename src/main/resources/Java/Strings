Why did the String pool move from PermGen to the normal heap area?
    PermGen space is limited, the default size is just 64 MB.
    it was a problem with creating and storing too many string objects in PermGen space.
    That’s why the String pool was moved to a larger heap area.
    To make Java more memory efficient, the concept of string literal is used.
    By the use of the ‘new’ keyword, The JVM will create a new string object in the normal heap area
    even if the same string object is present in the string pool.

Why string objects are immutable in Java?
    Because java uses the concept of string literal.
    Suppose there are 5 reference variables, all refer to one object “Sachin”.
    If one reference variable changes the value of the object, it will be affected by all the reference variables.
    That is why string objects are immutable in Java.

What is the difference between == and equals() in Java, and how do they work when comparing objects?
    ==: This is a reference comparison operator. When used with objects, it compares the memory addresses (or references) of the objects.
    It checks whether two references point to the exact same object in memory, not whether the contents of the objects are the same.

    equals(): This is a method defined in the Object class (which all Java classes inherit).
    It is intended for value comparison. The default implementation of equals() compares memory addresses (similar to ==),
    but many classes (like String, Integer, etc.) override this method to compare the actual content of the objects.
